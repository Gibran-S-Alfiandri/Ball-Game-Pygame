This game is created mostly using Bahasa Indonesia.
Ball N Block Game is a 2D game that my friend and I made using Pygame to fulfill an assignment for a basic programming course.
The objective of this game is to move the ball so that it doesn't hit moving obstacles in the form of rectangle, which will increase in number as the level increases.
